# DjangoCrud

Input: 
- A Django model definition

Output: 
- Rest API input/output functionality
    - perhaps generated code
    - perhaps a function that has info about table schema in a db.
    
- HTML for frontend forms (Can we import that into another HTML file)
    - Modal, or otherwise
    - Bootstrap or otherwise

- JS to serialize & post data from front end, and process response from backend

Q's:
- How to easily hook it into another app?
